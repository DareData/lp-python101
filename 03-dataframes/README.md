# Pandas and DataFrames

Pandas is a fundamental package for **analysis and manipulation of tabular data** in Python. Similar to spreadsheets (e.g. Excel) and databases (e.g.SQL), tables in Pandas are comprised of rows and columns which form a `DataFrame`. Individually, a 1-dimensional row or column is called a `Series`.

Pandas is a *de facto* tool for manipulating data with Python. It is fast, enables reshaping/pivoting, allows to merge/join datasets and aggregate data with groupby operations, supports time series functionality, and (most of all) is widely supported online (many tutorials and stack overflow answers to guide your journey).
