# General Python

The first question of every course should be *Why?*. Why do we want to learn Python? Why choosing Python among the vast majority of programming languages?

## The Why's

## Jupyter Notebooks vs Scripts

One of the things most people tend to miss when teaching Python is to teach students how to **properly program** as you would do at a company. In the following video, there is an in-depth discussion of two programming experts on when to use each. **Pay attention** that some of the things will be a bit advanced, but it is also good for you to start listening to these words!

## Variables and basic operators

A variable is a container for a value. We use variables to store values that we can later use by their names. Instead of memorizing all the values, we store the value once and perform all of the operations referencing their name afterwards.

The operators allow you to perform operations on variables and values. There are multiple categories of operators, but we'll focus on the most useful ones.

## How to execute a Python Script from the command line

## How to run Notebooks

## Let's play!

Before leaving this section, it's important that you can execute your own Python code and be comfortable with Jupyter notebooks.
Head over to the `1-general_python.ipynb` and run the code you see in there. Also, try to run the `example.py` file from the command line! 

After being able to do both of these tasks, you're good to go!
