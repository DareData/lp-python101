# Jupyter notebook
### Exercise 1 - Large Caps

Given the dict below (you can copy-paste it into your jupyter notebook) of companies with largest market cap, create a new `marketcap_large` dictionary containing only companies above 2$T.

marketcap = {
    "Apple": 2.537, 
    "Saudi Aramco": 2.392, 
    "Microsoft": 2.074, 
    "Alphabet": 1.535, 
    "Amazon": 1.184
}

# Script

### Exercise 2 

Choose the most appropriate flow control for the applications below. Choose from if-else, while, for, continue, break. The objective is to create 3 scripts.
    Create a greeting.py script that, given a list of people `['John', 'Maggie', 'Mark']`, greets them by name (print "Hi" + name) 
    Create a give_me_a_pastel.py that will request a "pastel de nata" input and won't stop asking until the user gives you a correct input.
    Create a six_seven_lover.py that, between 1 and 10, will print the numbers 6 and 7 and skip everything else.

### Exercise 3 - Happy New Year

Create a countdown_1.py and countdown_2.py scripts with two New Year's Countdowns, one with `while` and one with `for` loops. At "midnight", print "HAPPY NEW YEAR FOLKS!".

*Tip: don't forget the `range` from Session 1.
