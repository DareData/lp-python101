Let's build a simple form application. Your task will be to ask the users some information, store it in variables, perform simple operations and display a user report in the end. The form must:

    Ask for the user's name, weirdest habit, favourite hobbie and best quality;
    Store the informations in variables, which are easily readable;
    Display a profile report about the user.


Make sure that you make it as a script file, that is, one should be able to execute it from the terminal with a simple `python script_name.py`.
