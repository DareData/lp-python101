# Jupyter notebook

Write a jupyter notebook that shows the answers to these questions (try to also use markdown cells to explain what you are visualizing and the results)

    What is the dtype of a Series with mixed data types? e.g. float, int, strings
    Create a DataFrame from a dict. e.g. band DataFrame from the learning notebook
    In separate cells, get the first and last 5 elements of the new dataframe (tip: methods from Basic Functionality section)
