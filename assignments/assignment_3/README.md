# Jupyter notebook

Write a jupyter notebook that shows the answers to these questions (try to also use markdown cells to explain what you are visualizing and the results)

- What is the dtype of a Series with mixed data types? e.g. float, int, strings
- Create a DataFrame from a dict. e.g. band DataFrame from the learning notebook
- In separate cells, get the first and last 5 elements of the new dataframe (tip: methods from Basic Functionality section)


# Script

We have a basic company script that creates a very simple report. We want to take it up a notch and make it super cool. Furthermore, there are a couple of mistakes:

- John no longer works at the company, so we need to erase his info
- Rober was replaced by an AI, so we need a new column called "Replaced_by_AI" that contains "Yes" or "No" for each worker
- Print the information about the four partners: Carol, Ivo, Nuno and Rui
- Check and print the amount of people in the company together with the amount of people that have been in the company for 5 or more years
- Reset the index to be numeric and make the name as a new column called "Name"
