# Jupyter notebook

- Create the following list [50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
- Create a countdown from 10 to 0 with range (like New Year's Eve!!)
- Given an empty list
   - Add the following elements: 2, 3, 5, 8, 13
   - Store the first element in the 'first' variable
   - Store the last element in the 'last' variable
   - Store the third element in the 'third' variable
   - Store the second to last element in the 'second_to_last' variable

# Script

### Googling skills

Search what is the Pythonic way to

- Get the number of items in a dict, set, tuple and list
- Check if an element exists in a dict, set, tuple or list
- Change the value of a specific element in a list (e.g. 2nd item)
- Reverse the items in a list

Now, write a script that gives a report on a list of your choosing, this is, the script should:
- Print the original list you created: at least, one element should appear twice
- Print a message informing about the number of items prior to cleaning
- Change the value of a specific element
- Remove all repeated elements 
- Reverse the items
- Print the cleaned final list
